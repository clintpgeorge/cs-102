## Set up git 

I assume you use a Linux, Mac, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment. Execute the command  

    git --version 

to check whether git is installed. To add your credentials to git, use the following 

    git config --global user.name "Name"
    git config --global user.email "Email"

You may also wish add the following settings to avoid issues with line endings. Interested readers can look at this Stack Overflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/170961/whats-the-strategy-for-handling-crlf-carriage-return-line-feed-with-git/10855862#10855862) or this [blog](https://zachgollwitzer.com/posts/2019/git-crash-course/)

    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    git config --global core.safecrlf true


## Set up SSH key

We can check whether our computer already has an SSH key generated by listing files in the hiddend folder `.ssh`. 

    ls -la ~/.ssh | grep 'id_rsa'

It will list two entries `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` if it exists. Otherwise, create the key pair via running 

    ssh-keygen -t RSA

from the home folder. 

## Add SSH public key to GitHub 

Copy the contents of the public key file (i.e. `id_rsa.pub`) to 

-> GitHub Settings 

-> SSH and GPG Keys 

-> New SSH Key

Github now has a record of your computer. 

## Cloning a GitHub repository

First, create a GitHub repository named `cs102-git-essentials`. Then, from the command line execute 

    git clone git@github.com:<username>/cs102-git-essentials.git

from the folder where you want to keep your local reposiory. It will create folder `cs102-git-essentials` with a hiddle directory named `.git`.
