## Course Eligibility and Requirements

- This is a core course designed for first-year, Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Mathematics and Computing (MnC) students. 
  
- Course prerequisites: None


## Student Evaluations  

We follow a continuous evaluation plan throughout this course, which includes 

- Classroom participation (lectures, labs led by TAs, etc.) is essential throughout the course. 80% percentage of attendance is mandatory for class interactions. Poor attendance may lead to [FX grade](https://iitgoa.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/IIT-Goa-Grading-System-v1-2.pdf). 
  
- Programming/homework/lab/project assignments. Discussions with classmates are encouraged, but every student must submit individual solutions in a prescribed form. 

- There will be classroom quizzes. All quizzes are mandatory. 

- Mid-semester and end-semester examinations

Note: _No makeup exam/quiz/assignments will be conducted._

## Expectations from Students 

- **Course load**. We expect that every student will spend 6-8 hours a week in addition to lecture hours and other online/in-classroom interactions. It’s a programming-based course. We assume that students have access to computers.  

- **Late submissions** will not be accepted for programming assignments, homework, etc. Students must follow the submission guidelines mentioned in projects, assignments, quizzes, and exams to get full credits. 

- **Academic Honesty.** We expect that every student follows the highest standards of integrity and academic honesty. Copying/sharing code in exams, homework, lab sessions are not permitted. We may use automated software tools to detect plagiarism in assignments, exams, etc. If we detect **any form of plagiarism** in a submission, we grade the submission zero. See the IIT Goa policy for academic malpractices. 

## Grading Policy

The **tentative** grade distribution for the course is follows

- Quizzes and Midterm (30%) 

- Homework/Programming/Lab assignments/Mini-project (30%)

- Final (40%)
